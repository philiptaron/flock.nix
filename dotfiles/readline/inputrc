# Philip Taron's readline configuration.
# Full docs: https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/readline.html

# Controls what happens when Readline wants to ring the terminal bell.
# If set to ‘none’, Readline never rings the bell.
# If set to ‘visible’, Readline uses a visible bell if one is available.
# If set to ‘audible’ (the default), Readline attempts to ring the terminal’s bell.
set bell-style none

# Allow UTF-8 input and output, instead of showing stuff like $'\0123\0456'.
set input-meta on
set output-meta on
set convert-meta off

# If set to 'on', Readline displays possible completions using different colors to indicate their
# file type. The color definitions are taken from the value of the LS_COLORS environment variable.
set colored-stats on

# Show extra file information when completing, like `ls -F` does.
set visible-stats on

# Make Tab autocomplete regardless of filename case.
set completion-ignore-case on

# Make hyphens and underscores be case-equivalent.
set completion-map-case on

# List all matches in case multiple possible completions are possible.
set show-all-if-ambiguous on

# Immediately add a trailing slash when autocompleting directories and symlinks to directories.
set mark-directories on
set mark-symlinked-directories on

# Do not autocomplete hidden files unless the pattern explicitly begins with a dot
set match-hidden-files off

# Show all autocomplete results at once
set page-completions off

# If there are more than 250 possible completions for a word, ask to show them all
set completion-query-items 250

# Be more intelligent when autocompleting by also looking at the text after the cursor.
# Attempting completion when the cursor is after the 'e' in 'Makefile' will result in 'Makefile'
# rather than 'Makefilefile', assuming there is a single possible completion.
set skip-completed-text on

# All the key bindings below here are determined using `showkey -a`.

# Home: go to the beginning of the line.
"\e[1~": beginning-of-line

# End: go to the end of the line.
"\e[4~": end-of-line

# Up: use the cursor position as a prefix search backwards through the command history.
"\e[A": history-search-backward

# Down: use the cursor position as a prefix search forwards through the command history.
"\e[B": history-search-forward

# Page Up: go to the first command typed this session.
"\e[5~": beginning-of-history

# Page Down: go to the last command typed this session.
"\e[6~": end-of-history

# Insert: add the next character typed to the line verbatim.
# This is how to insert key sequences like C-q, for example.
"\e[2~": quoted-insert

# Delete: delete a character.
"\e[3~": delete-char

# Alt-Delete: delete the following word.
"\e[3;3~": kill-word

# Ctrl-Left: move one word forward.
"\e[1;5C": forward-word

# Ctrl-Right: move one word backward.
"\e[1;5D": backward-word
